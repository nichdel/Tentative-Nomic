=====================================================================
Rule 2.0 | The Rules about Rules | Power 3
------------------------------------------

Each rule has a Rule Number, which is the next sequential integer
after the last integer that has ever been used to define a rule.

Each rule has a revision number, which is the number of changes made
to the rule since it was enacted.

Each rule has a Power Number, which is a whole, positive integer.

Each rule has a title, which has no effect.

Each rule has a text, which is considered to be a series of facts
about the game.

Rules cannot be changed except as described by the rules.

Rules have no effect on or application to events and states which
existed before the rule existed and no longer exist; rules can
neither be retroactive or have ex post facto effects.

The rules should be listed with a history of changes and relevant
annotations.
