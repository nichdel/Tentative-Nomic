Rule 3.0 | Precedence, Application, and Paradox | Power 3
---------------------------------------------------------

When two or more rules conflict, the conflicting part of the rule
with lower precedence is considered null whenever the conflict arises.

Rules with higher Power Numbers have higher precedence. Rules with
lower Rule Numbers have higher precedence.

When text within the same rule conflicts, all but the last of the
conflicting parts of the rule are considered null whenever the
conflict arises.

Rule changes do not conflict with the rule they are changing on that
warrant alone.
