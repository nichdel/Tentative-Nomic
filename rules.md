=====================================================================
Rule 1.0 | The Three-Fold Contract | Power 3
--------------------------------------------

Joining
   
    The Rules shall not prevent or obstruct someone from becoming a
    player.

    Any person may become a player. All players must be welcoming and
    reasonably accomodating to interested people and new players.

Participating

    The rules shall not be changed in a way that makes them
    unintelligible or unenjoyable. The rules shall not make play
    unreasonably demanding. The rules shall allow all players to
    participate.

    All players must attempt to obey all rules as they are written
    and intended. All players must defend the spirit of the game.

Quitting

    The rules shall not prevent, delay, or punish quitting.

    Any player may quit at any time.

=====================================================================
Rule 2.0 | The Rules about Rules | Power 3
------------------------------------------

Each rule has a Rule Number, which is the next sequential number after
the highest of any other rule that has ever existed.

Each rule has a Revision Number, which is the number of changes made
to the rule since it was enacted.

Each rule has a Power Number, which is a whole, positive integer.

Each rule has a Title, which has no effect.

Each rule has a Text, which is considered to be a series of facts
about the game.

Rules cannot be changed except as described by the rules.

Rules have no effect on or application to events and states which
existed before the rule existed and no longer exist; rules can
neither be retroactive or have ex post facto effects.

The rules should be listed with a history of changes and relevant
annotations.

=====================================================================
Rule 3.0 | Precedence, Application, and Paradox | Power 3
---------------------------------------------------------

When two or more rules conflict, the conflicting part of the rule
with lower precedence is considered null whenever the conflict arises.

Rules with higher Power Numbers have higher precedence. Rules with
lower Rule Numbers have higher precedence.

When text within the same rule conflicts, all but the last of the
conflicting parts of the rule are considered null whenever the
conflict arises.

Rule changes do not conflict with the rule they are changing on that
warrant alone.

=====================================================================
Rule 4.0 | Changing Rules | Power 3
-----------------------------------

A rule change is enacting, amending, or repealing any rule.

A proposal specifies at least one rule change in a way that leaves no
ambiguity as to the final result of the changes if they occur.

Any player may submit a proposal.

If a proposal passes, it changes the rules as specified. No proposal
has retroactive effect or legal effect before passing.

=====================================================================
Rule 5.0 | Passing Proposals | Power 3
--------------------------------------

Quorum is 2/5ths of all players.

The required fraction of a proposal is n/(n+1), where n is the highest
Power Number of any existing or proposed rules involved in the
proposal, before or after the proposal passes. If the Power Number is
1, the required fraction is (n+0.1)/n+1.

A proposal passes if, after its voting period, it has been voted on
by a quorum of players and at least the required fraction of players
who voted voted FOR.

=====================================================================
Rule 6.0 | Winning is not the End | Power 3
-------------------------------------------

When a game is won, a new game immediately begins with the same rules.

All other details of the gamestate carry over except where specified.

=====================================================================
Rule 7.0 | The Speaker | Power 2
--------------------------------

Immediately as a game begins, there is a vote to decide the Speaker
of that game. Once a simple majority votes for a single player that
player becomes the Speaker. When a simple majority becomes
impossible, the player with the largest number of votes wins.

Each player may vote once and all votes must be submitted.

=====================================================================
Rule 8.0 | The Forum and Submission | Power 2
---------------------------------------------

Immediately after a Speaker is decided upon for a game, the Speaker
may submit a designation of a forum.

A forum must allow any person to view all discussion, allow any
person to submit intent to become a player, and allow any player to
submit any text.

Submitting something is a process by which a specified player makes
a specified text available to the public while allowing all players
to receive notice of this event. A suitable forum automates as much
of this as reasonable.

=====================================================================
Rule 9.0 | Voting Periods | Power 2
-----------------------------------

Once a week the Speaker shall submit (with a unique numeric ID) all
proposals that have been submitted since the last time the Speaker
did so; this begins the voting period of every rule that the Speaker
has just submitted.

Each player may submit exactly one vote on each proposal during its
voting period. Valid votes are FOR, PRESENT, and AGAINST.

For the required fraction of a proposal, only FOR and AGAINST are
counted.

The voting period ends after 4 days. The Speaker (with reasonable
delay) shall submit the results of each proposal's voting period and
an updated listing of all rules.

=====================================================================
Rule 10.0 | Calls for Judgement | Power 2
-----------------------------------------

Any player may submit a Call For Judgment on a specified text. The
Speaker shall then number the Call For Judgment and assign a random
player (who is not the original submitter) to judge the text; this
player is the judge.

Until the text is judged, every player except the judge is encouraged
to submit arguments for or against the statement's truth.

The judge may submit a judgment of TRUE, FALSE, or UNDECIDED; thus
judging the text.

If a text is judged TRUE, the text should be considered a TRUTH about
the game unless a rule or later judgment contradicts it.

If a judge does not judge the text for 7 days or judges it UNDECIDED,
the Speaker may either choose a different random player or themselves
to be the new judge.

=====================================================================
Rule 11.0 | Anti-Quorum Inflation | Power 1
-------------------------------------------

If a player has not voted on any proposal in the last 2 voting
periods, the Speaker may deregister them and shall submit a text
specifying who e has deregistered.

This cannot be used if there have not been 2 voting periods.

=====================================================================
Rule 12.0 | Trade | Power 1
---------------------------

Items are entities which players can possess.

Players may submit a trade offer by specifying some set of items they
possess, some set of items they want, and optionally a player who
posses the wanted items.

Any player may submit a trade acceptance by specifying a trade offer
IF AND ONLY IF 1) the trade offer is still active, 2) they possess all
wanted items, and 3) if applicable, they are the specified player.

If a trade offer is accepted, the submitter no longer possesses the
specfied set of items they possessed, or the submitter submits a trade
withdrawal (specifying the trade offer), the trade offer is no longer
active; otherwise it is.

When a trade offer is accepted, the items the submitter possessed
become possessed by the accepter (and thus lost by the submitter)
and the items the submitter wanted become possessed by the
submitter (and thus lost by the accepter).

=====================================================================
Rule 13.0 | Currency | Power 1
------------------------------

Credit is a type of item. When a player registers for the first time,
they automatically possess 100 credits. All players who are registered
at the time this rule passes also possess 100 credits.

=====================================================================
Rule 14.0 | The Cabinet | Power 1
---------------------------------

The speaker may create, destroy, or modify a specified cabinet
position by submision. The speaker may also assign or unassign a
player to a specified cabinet position by submission.

Each cabinet position has a title and a list of duties, which should
deal with tracking gamestate. The player assigned to a cabinet
position should weekly report all changes to gamestate related to
their duties.

=====================================================================
Rule 15.0 | Valor Victory | Power 1
-----------------------------------

Badges and Medals are types of items. If a badge or medal can be
"awarded" under some conditions, then any player may submit a Award
Announcement specifying a badge or medal and a player that meets the
conditions. The player specified then receives one of the specified
badge or medal. No badge or medal can be awarded to any player that
already has one of that type of badge. Only one badge or medal can be
awarded for a single event.

Each badge belongs to a league. Each league has a single type of medal
and any player can be awarded it if they have at least one of each
badge associated with the league. When a player is awarded a medal,
they lose all their badges that belong to that league.

If a player has more medals than any other player for 15 consecutive
days, they win.
